Structure, governance and management

Reserves Policy

The reserves policy covers the level of free reserves that would be immediately available for activities
within the RA's overall purpose and would be appropriate for the charity to hold on a continuing basis.
This level takes into account potential volatility in income streams and allows for fluctuations in
essential expenditure.

Risk Management
The Board identifies the key risks facing the RA which are documented in a risk register and discussed
with and approved by the Trustees on a regular basis.

Appointment of Directors

Directors are appointed by vote at the AGM. Directors may be co-opted onto the Board by Board vote
during the course of the year. These co-optees are to be formally appointed as Directors at the
subsequent Board meeting.

Related Parties

The Rationalist Association maintains a separate company, the Rationalist Press Association, which is a
company limited by guarantee, but which is not registered as a charity. The sole member of the RPA is
the RA. It is the policy of the RA that this separate legal entity, which has existed for many years and
which continues to benefit from long-standing legacies, should be maintained outside of the constraints
of charitable status.

Objectives and activities

Principal activity

Promoting rationalism and humanism through the publication of New Humanist magazine, the New
Humanist website and other media.

About the Rationalist Association

The Rationalist Association is a company limited by guarantee (number 4118489). It is registered as a
charity (number 1096577). The Association's registered office is at Development House G03, 56-64
Leonard Street, London EC2A 4LT.

The Association is governed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were last amended by
special resolution dated 23 May 2011. Under these, the Objectives of the Rationalist Association are:

"The mental and moral improvement of the human race by means of the advancement of rationalism
and humanism. The advancement of education and in particular the study of rationalism and humanism
and the dissemination of knowledge of their principles. The relief of poverty among members or former
members or their dependants or employees or former employees or their dependants of the Rationalist
Press Association Limited and The Rationalist Association.”

The Association is managed by the Board of Directors, who are the Trustees of the Charity. The Directors
are appointed by the Annual General Meeting of the Association, and must retire by rotation one third
each year. The Board may co-opt additional Directors during the year, subject to their being submitted for
appointment at the next following AGM.

The Trustees are committed to openness and transparency in recruiting new Trustees. Candidates are
invited to provide a CV and personal statement. New trustees are formally appointed by the AGM and are
inducted and any training necessary is provided.

Report on Public Benefit

The Rationalist Association aims to promote rational inquiry based on evidence rather than belief in
pursuit of its charitable object, the advancement of rationalism and humanism; and to demonstrate that a
moral life is possible -indeed preferable -based upon a naturalistic and scientific understanding of the
world and humanity's place in it. A great deal of this work is achieved through the medium of New
Humanist magazine, but also through other channels such as our website, public talks and social media.

New Humanist magazine is published quarterly, in full colour. We aim for New Humanist to reach a wide
audience for the promotion of our ideals, and the benefit of recipients. First, through subscriptions and
bookshop sales, and associated donations, we aim to maximise our income from those who whether
currently supporters or not -are able to pay. Then, within the resources this makes available, we give
away free copies to a range of schools, libraries, prisons and individuals who cannot afford to pay. We
publish the majority of the magazine content, and original web-only articles and reviews, on our website,
which is free to use for all who have access to a computer. We also produce regular newsletters which are
free.

Just as important is the role the RA plays in public advocacy, publicising and educating about rationalist
and humanist values at events -literary events like the Stoke Newington Literary Festival,
The Rationalist Association

Company Limited by Guarantee

Directors’ Annual Report (Incorporating the Director’s Report) (continued)
Year ended 31 December 2017

 

panel discussions, -and through appearances in the local and national media. We also aim to make New
Humanist a resource for the wider humanist and atheist movements, covering campaigns by the BHA and
National Secular Society among others.

All this charitable activity is made possible by past and present benefactors whose legacies, donations and
membership subscriptions enable us to support the promotion of rationalism and humanism to as many
people as possible, regardless of whether they are able to pay.

Achievements and performance

Review of the year

Tom Smith was formally appointed our Chief Executive in April this year having been the de facto
incumbent from the summer of 2016.

2017 continued our administrative consolidation for the Rationalist Association (RA) with the emphasis
on streamlining personnel and costs. This is reflected in our significantly reduced expenditure whilst
maintaining the same production levels as 2016. This reduction in costs has not prevented our annual
deficit but we have now moved our focus to income. We have launched two income stream projects
which are expected to generate income from 2018, being the creation of a fundraising function and
digitising our magazine archive. The catalyst for the archive project was a donation in 2017 by one of our
members allowing us to partner with the British Library to produce high quality digital products. Our
digital archive will be financially targeted at institutional subscribers but will be available to ordinary RA
members as an ongoing benefit of their annual membership fees.

Our objective of expanding the reputation and audience of New Humanist, in print, online and at public
events was hampered by two time-consuming issues during the year; the unforeseen demise of COMAG
(our magazine newsstand distributor) due to its two shareholders withdrawing from that business sector
and separately, a lengthy Employment Tribunal claim by a former consultant. The latter ultimately failed
and although our legal costs were underwritten by our insurers, our own time and administration were
not. Both these matters were successfully overcome but they diverted our limited administrative
resources away from their primary function throughout the year until the end of November 2017.

The number of RA members at the end of 2017 was 441 (2016: 479). On average some 6,500 copies of
the magazine were printed each quarter for distribution. This includes free distribution of New
Humanist to prisons libraries as part our charitable objectives.

There are two developments due to arise in the near future justifying comment, being an office
relocation some time in 2018 and a significant legacy by a member who passed away in 2016:

e Our current office/building is scheduled for demolition so we will be moving into The Green House
(Cambridge Heath Road, London, E2 9DA) , being a newly developed commercial building by our
current landlord which will provide twice the NFP/Charity tenanting space of Development House
but with the same associated benefits. This was due to take place in February 2018 but the final
relocation schedule moved to 27 July 2018

e We have received formal confirmation that we are due to receive a significant financial legacy in
2018 which is currently undergoing probate

Year ended 31 December 2017

Financial review
The results for the year are set out in the financial statements for the RA.

The deficit for the year was £21,279 (2016: £52,522). The current year's reduced deficit results solely
from the reduction in expenditure.

The investment portfolio of the RA decreased in the year due to planned disposals of investments.
However, the value of the remaining portfolio increased above 2016 values due to a rise in stock market
levels compared to the previous year. The net assets of the RA at 31st December 2017 were £800,458
(2016: £768,309).

Small company provisions

This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions applicable to companies entitled to the
small companies exemption. The directors' annual report was approved on 13 July 2018 and signed on
behalf of the board of trustees by:

Clive Coen
Director
Independent Examiner’s Report to the Trustees of The Rationalist Association

I report to the charity trustees on my examination of the accounts of the company for the year ended 31
December 2017 which are set out on pages 7 to 21.

Responsibilities and basis of report

As the charity trustees of the company (and also its directors for the purposes of company law) you are
responsible for the preparation of the accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”).

Having satisfied myself that the accounts of the company are not required to be audited under Part 16
of the 2006 Act and are eligible for independent examination, I report in respect of my examination of
your company’s accounts as carried out under section 145 of the Charities Act 2011 (“the 2011 Act”).
In carrying out my examination I have followed the Directions given by the Charity Commission under
section 145(5)(b) of the 2011 Act.

Independent Examiner’s statement

I have completed my examination. I have identified a matter of concern in my report because I have
concerns that there may have been material loss to the charity arising as follows.

The trustees became concerned about the level of administrative costs and sought justification of the
costs being charged to the charity. As a result of the trustees not being satisfied with the explanations
given, the person responsible left the company and a second, more junior person left abruptly before
they could be questioned. Both people had been retained on a self-employed basis (i.e. they were not
on the payroll and were not classed as employees). It is not clear whether this matter is materially
significant under section 156 of the 2011 Act but it has been reported to the relevant authorities by the
trustees and is quite likely to have been financially material in its effect on the charity.

I confirm that no other matters have come to my attention in connection with the examination giving
me cause to believe that in any material respect:

1. accounting records were not kept in respect of the company as required by section 386 of the

2006 Act; or

the accounts do not accord with those records; or

3. the accounts do not comply with the accounting requirements of section 396 of the 2006 Act
other than any requirement that the accounts give a “true and fair view” which is not a matter
considered as part of an independent examination; or

4. the accounts have not been prepared in accordance with the methods and principles of the
Statement of Recommended Practice for Accounting and Reporting by Charities applicable to
charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS102).

I confirm that there are no other matters to which your attention should be drawn to enable a proper
understanding of the accounts to be reached.

General information

The charity is a private company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales anda
registered charity in England and Wales. The address of the registered office is 56-64 Leonard
Street, London, EC2A 4LT.

Statement of compliance

These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with FRS 102, 'The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland’, the Statement of
Recommended Practice applicable to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (Charities SORP
(FRS 102)) and the Charities Act 2011.

Accounting policies

Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as modified by the
revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities and investment properties measured at fair
value through income or expenditure.

Going concern
There are no material uncertainties about the charity's ability to continue.

Disclosure exemptions
The entity satisfies the criteria of being a qualifying entity as defined in FRS 102. As such, advantage
has been taken of the following disclosure exemptions available under paragraph 1.12 of FRS 102:

(a) No cash flow statement has been presented for the company.
(b) Disclosures in respect of financial instruments have not been presented.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. These estimates and judgements
are continually reviewed and are based on experience and other factors, including expectations
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The judgements
(apart from those involving estimations) that management has made in the process of applying
the entity's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the financial statements are as follows: the valuation of the Fixed Asset
Investments.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty Accounting estimates and assumptions are made
concerning the future and, by their nature, will rarely equal the related actual outcome. The key
assumptions concerning the future are that costs will continue to be controlled and income will
be improved. There are no other sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year.

financial year.

Income tax

The charity is an exempt charity within the meaning of Schedule 3 of the Charities Act 2011 and is
considered to pass the tests set out in Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 Finance Act 2010 and therefore it
meets the definition of a charitable company for UK corporation tax purposes.

Fund accounting

Unrestricted funds are available for use at the discretion of the trustees to further any of the
charity's purposes.

Designated funds are unrestricted funds earmarked by the directors for particular future project or
commitment.

Restricted funds are subjected to restrictions on their expenditure declared by the donor or
through the terms of an appeal, and fall into one of two sub-classes: restricted income funds or
endowment funds.

Incoming resources

All incoming resources are included in the statement of financial activities when entitlement has
passed to the charity; it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will
flow to the charity and the amount can be reliably measured. The following specific policies are
applied to particular categories of income:

e income from donations or grants is recognised when there is evidence of entitlement to
the gift, receipt is probable and its amount can be measured reliably.

e legacy income is recognised when receipt is probable and entitlement is established.

e income from donated goods is measured at the fair value of the goods unless this is
impractical to measure reliably, in which case the value is derived from the cost to the
donor or the estimated resale value. Donated facilities and services are recognised in the
accounts when received if the value can be reliably measured. No amounts are included for
the contribution of general volunteers.

e Income from contracts for the supply of services is recognised with the delivery of the
contracted service. This is classified as unrestricted funds unless there is a contractual
requirement for it to be spent on a particular purpose and returned if unspent, in which
case it may be regarded as restricted.

3. Accounting policies (continued)

Resources expended

Expenditure is recognised on an accruals basis as a liability is incurred. Expenditure includes any
VAT which cannot be fully recovered, and is classified under headings of the statement of financial
activities to which it relates:

e expenditure on raising funds includes the costs of all fundraising activities, events, noncharitable trading activities, and the sale of donated goods.

e expenditure on charitable activities includes all costs incurred by a charity in undertaking
activities that further its charitable aims for the benefit of its beneficiaries, including those
support costs and costs relating to the governance of the charity apportioned to charitable
activities

e other expenditure includes all expenditure that is neither related to raising funds for the
charity nor part of its expenditure on charitable activities.

All costs are allocated to expenditure categories reflecting the use of the resource. Direct costs
attributable to a single activity are allocated directly to that activity. Shared costs are apportioned
between the activities they contribute to on a reasonable, justifiable and consistent basis.

Tangible assets

Tangible assets are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently stated at cost less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. Any tangible assets carried at revalued amounts are recorded
at the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An increase in the carrying amount of an asset as a result of a revaluation, is recognised in other
recognised gains and losses, unless it reverses a charge for impairment that has previously been
recognised as expenditure within the statement of financial activities. A decrease in the carrying
amount of an asset as a result of revaluation, is recognised in other recognised gains and losses,
except to which it offsets any previous revaluation gain, in which case the loss is shown within
other recognised gains and losses on the statement of financial activities.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or valuation of an asset, less its residual value,
over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:

Fixtures and fittings - 20% straight line
Equipment - 25% straight line
Computer systems - 33% straight line
Investments

Listed investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised in income
or expenditure.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment of fixed assets

A review for indicators of impairment is carried out at each reporting date, with the recoverable
amount being estimated where such indicators exist. Where the carrying value exceeds the
recoverable amount, the asset is impaired accordingly. Prior impairments are also reviewed for
possible reversal at each reporting date. For the purposes of impairment testing, when it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, an estimate is made of the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The cash-generating
unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and generates cash inflows
that largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.is recognise

Stocks

Stocks are measured at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the
stock to its present location and condition.

Financial instruments

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised only when the charity becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.

Basic financial instruments are initially recognised at the amount receivable or payable including
any related transaction costs.

Current assets and current liabilities are subsequently measured at the cash or other consideration
expected to be paid or received and not discounted.

Debt instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

Where investments in shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured
reliably, the investment is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognised in income and expenditure. All other such investments are subsequently measured at
cost less impairment.

Other financial instruments, including derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value, unless
payment for an asset is deferred beyond normal business terms or financed at a rate of interest
that is not a market rate, in which case the asset is measured at the present value of the future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.

Other financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, with any changes recognised
in the statement of financial activities, with the exception of hedging instruments in a designated
hedging relationship.

Financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost are reviewed for objective evidence of
impairment at the end of each reporting date. If there is objective evidence of impairment, an
impairment loss is recognised under the appropriate heading in the statement of financial activities
in which the initial gain was recognised.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
For all equity instruments regardless of significance, and other financial assets that are
individually significant, these are assessed individually for impairment. Other financial assets are
either assessed individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics.
Any reversals of impairment are recognised immediately, to the extent that the reversal does not
result in a carrying amount of the financial asset that exceeds what the carrying amount would
have been had the impairment not previously been recognised.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which
the related service is provided. A defined contribution scheme is available to staff.

4. Limited by guarantee

The Rationalist Association is a company, registered in England and Wales, limited by guarantee.
In the event of the charity being wound up, the liability in respect of the guarantee is limited to
